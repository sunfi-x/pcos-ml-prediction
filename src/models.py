"""Model definitions, assembled as leakage-safe pipelines.

Every model is a single :class:`imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline` containing the
whole chain:

``impute -> scale/encode -> select features -> SMOTE -> classifier``

Packaging it this way is the point of the module. When such a pipeline is
handed to ``cross_val_score``, scikit-learn refits *every* step on each
training fold, so the imputer, the scaler, the feature selector and SMOTE
never observe the held-out fold. The alternative — imputing, selecting and
oversampling the full dataset up front and cross-validating afterwards — is
what produces the 98-99% accuracies reported by several of the reviewed
papers, because SMOTE will happily synthesise a validation-set point from
its own training-set neighbours.

The imblearn ``Pipeline`` (rather than the scikit-learn one) is required
because SMOTE resamples rows: it must run on ``fit`` but be skipped on
``predict``, which only imblearn's pipeline knows how to do.
