DISCUSSION = """
Reading the comparison table
----------------------------

Papers 4 and 5 report 98.9-99.3% accuracy on the same 541-row dataset used
here. This project reports a lower number, and that gap is the most
important result in the report -- it is a methodology difference, not a
modelling failure.

Three things separate the protocols:

1. **Where the resampling happens.** If SMOTE runs before the train/test
   split, synthetic minority rows interpolated from training patients end up
   in the evaluation set. The model is then partly scored on points derived
   from data it trained on. The leakage experiment in this project measures
   that effect directly on the same dataset and the same classifier.

2. **Where feature selection happens.** Running RFE once on the full dataset
   lets the selector read every label, including the test labels, before the
   split. The chosen feature set is then tuned to the test set.

3. **How many splits.** A single 80/20 split of 541 rows puts about 35 PCOS
   cases in the test set. Three patients changing sides moves accuracy by
   roughly 3 points, so a single split can produce a very high number by
   chance. Repeated 10-fold CV averages that variance away.

None of this proves the reviewed papers made these mistakes -- most simply do
not report enough detail to tell, which is itself the finding. The honest
claim this project can make is narrower and better supported: under a
protocol where nothing downstream of the split can see the evaluation data,
this is the performance the Kaggle PCOS dataset supports.

Why the accuracy column is the least interesting one
-----------------------------------------------------

Ranking six studies by a single accuracy figure implies the differences mean
something. Three results in this project say they largely do not:

1. **The winner is a coin flip.** Re-splitting this dataset 30 times, every
   one of nine algorithms took first place at least once, and the most
   frequent winner managed 17%. Each model's own test AUC moves by 0.08-0.15
   depending only on which patients land in the test set.

2. **The intervals overlap everything.** Our test ROC-AUC of 0.94 carries a
   95% bootstrap CI of roughly [0.87, 0.98], and recall spans [0.70, 0.94].
   No reviewed paper reports an interval, but theirs would be similar --
   the sample size is identical.

3. **Nobody validated externally, and on this data nobody could.** Our own
   attempt (see src/external.py) found that the only genuinely independent
   public cohort shares 8 weak features with this one. The discriminating
   features -- follicle counts and symptoms -- exist in no compatible public
   dataset.

So the useful comparison between these studies is not which number is
highest. It is which studies state their protocol, report uncertainty,
measure calibration, and check whether the model is clinically worth using.
On that comparison the accuracy column is close to noise.
